# GreenT
This is my colorscheme for vim. Feel free to use it or make suggestions on how I could improve it:smile:

## Installation (Linux)
Put the `.vim` file in the `colors` folder in your `.vim` directory (if it does not exist create it).
Add this line to your `.vimrc` file:
```
colorscheme greent
```
